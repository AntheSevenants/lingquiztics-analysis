# Lingquiztics: analysis

This is a quick-and-dirty analysis of the results of our Department of Linguistics quiz. The data was keyed in manually by me in Excel and then exported. There's room for much better statistics, but I only have so much time. Too bad!

To generate the report, render `ResultsReport.qmd` with Quarto. I have attached a Docker set-up to spin up the correct environment immediately.
